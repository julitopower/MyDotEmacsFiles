# Contents

In this project we have two main pieces of content, (a) under the ```mac``` directory there is an old emacs configuration I used to used years ago, and no longer used, (b) under the elisp directory there are a number of useful elisp scripts, which I've used both to learn, and to actually make my development experience smoother.
